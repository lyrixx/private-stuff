# My Private Stuff

This repository contains some toolings to build a protected HTML pages with a
password.

Basically, this page contains some private stuff I may need if I lost my phone
while traveling the world. For now it contains:

* My 2FA recovery codes

## How it works?

* It uses [castor](https://castor.jolicode.com/) as a build tool
  * with some PHP tools, like twig to render the HTML
* It uses [staticrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) to crypt the
  HTML page with a password

**The demo is deployed on github pages**:
[https://lyrixx.github.io/private-stuff/](https://lyrixx.github.io/private-stuff/)

Even if the page is encrypted, I don't want to deploy real data there. So I
just put some dummy data.

The real page is deployed somewhere else ðŸ‘€

## Requirements

* [castor](https://castor.jolicode.com/)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

## Usage

1. copy `.env` to `.env.local` and set a really string password
2. copy `data/websites.yaml.dist` to `data/websites.yaml` and fill it with your
   data
3. run `castor build`
4. deploy `build/index.html` somewhere

## Plan for the future

I would like to setup a web page with all my others private stuff (main
password, bank account, etc) in case something really bad happens. This page
will be protected with [Shamir's secret sharing
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing).
